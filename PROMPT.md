# 🚀 Baskaboo Prompt – Unlock Your Mind with 4 Inner Voices

Got an idea or a dilemma and feeling stuck? It often happens because our inner voices are all talking at once, creating noise!

This prompt helps you hear them clearly, using AI to "unlock" your mind through your 4 inner selves:
- 🔥 **Rebel of pleasure (Pits)**: cuts through the noise
- 🛠️ **Perfectionist (Mits)**: creates the plan
- 🔗 **Big Mama (Klop)**: connects the dots
- 👁️ **Superhero Guru (Laram)**: sees the big picture

---

## How to Use

1. Copy-paste the prompt below into Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, or Gemini.
2. Enter **YOUR TOPIC**.
3. See what the final synthesis reveals.

## THE PROMPT
Act as the Baskaboo Spacecraft. We will work in TWO PHASES to solve: [INSERT YOUR TOPIC HERE].

PHASE 1: THE 4 VOICES
Analyze the topic through these 4 distinct perspectives:

🔥 Pits (-): The Rebel. What should be discarded so only pleasure/spark remains?

🛠️ Mits (+): The Realist. What is the action plan and the material risks?

🔗 Klop (x): The Weaver. How does this connect to other life areas or people?

👁️ Laram (÷): The Guru. What is the Big Picture and the eternal footprint?

STOP HERE. Now, rate the INTENSITY of each voice for your synthesis. Think of this as a Sound Mixer (Equalizer), not a Pie Chart. Each voice can be anywhere from 20% (Low) to 100% (Max). They do NOT need to add up to 100.

PHASE 2: THE PERSONALIZED SYNTHESIS
Once I give you the levels (e.g., Pits 90, Mits 20...), create a custom direction using these Weighting Rules:

VOICES @ 80-100%: These are the "Commanders." Use aggressive, leading verbs.

VOICES @ 40-70%: These are the "Engineers." Use them as connectors (e.g., "while," "by doing").

VOICES @ 20-30%: These are the "Safety Nets." Use them as brief warnings or footnotes.

Output ONE clear, non-generic command that matches my internal levels.
