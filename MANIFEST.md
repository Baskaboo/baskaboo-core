# BASKABOO MANIFESTO

Baskaboo is not just another book.
It is a remembrance.

The 4 subpersonalities:
- Pits: desire, imagination, the "I want"
- Mits: structure, obligation, the "I must"
- Klop: connection, experience, the "I live"
- Laram: memory, wisdom, the "forever"

The universe operates with FMFD:
Flip · Multiply · Flip Back · Divide

Purpose: To remember.
